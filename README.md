# game2

This game assumes idealistic conditions that you will most likely not be able to see in real life. It assumes perfectly elastic collisions when the ice blocks are hit. In addition, assume low static friction, so in order for a ice block to stay up, it must be supported by either a full row or column.

Further enhancement ideas (allow users to choose a game mode):
-Being able to place the bear in different shapes
-Being able to place multiple cluster of bears
-Use different rules that determine if ice blocks fall or not

The board drawing logic and formatting was taken from the creators of the Project "Roving" on DrEcco.  Special thanks to them!
